1. As the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) in my group, I contributed to the project by testing the system to find errors and making sure everything worked properly. I checked if the features were functioning correctly and reported any issues to my teammates so they could fix them. I also gave suggestions to improve the quality of the project. One challenge I faced was finding all the possible errors while keeping up with the project deadline. Sometimes, explaining the problems clearly to my team was also difficult. Another challenge was making sure that all the fixes were done properly and tested again. From this experience, I learned how important it is to be patient and detailed when testing. I also improved my communication skills by explaining issues more clearly to my teammates. Moving forward, I want to learn more about testing tools to make my work more efficient.


2. Working with my team was a good experience. We helped each other and made sure the project was completed on time. The team communicated well, and everyone had their own tasks to do. One thing that went well was how we supported each other. Everyone listened and tried their best to do their part. However, sometimes testing felt rushed because there was not enough time. We can improve by planning better and giving more time for testing before finishing the project. Overall, teamwork made the project easier because we worked together, shared ideas, and helped one another when needed. Next time, I hope we can organize our tasks even better so that everything runs smoothly.

3. As a Software Quality Assurance (SQA), I want to improve my skills in finding mistakes and making sure everything works perfectly. Sometimes, I miss small errors, so I want to get better at paying attention to details. I also want to improve how I explain problems to my team so they can fix them faster. To get better, I will practice testing more carefully and double-check my work. I will also learn about new testing tools that can help me find mistakes more easily. I will ask my teammates for feedback so I can improve my way of explaining problems. By working hard and practicing, I can become better at my role and help my team even more.
